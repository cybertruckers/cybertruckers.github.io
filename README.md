# cybertruckers.github.io

Static site for ydz.world.

## Publishing updates
- The live site is served via GitHub Pages using the `main` branch and the `CNAME` file pointing to `ydz.world`.
- Changes on other branches (e.g., `work`) are not published until they are merged into `main` and pushed to GitHub.
- To update ydz.world, merge your changes into `main` and push; GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically.
- If the domain stops resolving, re-verify that the `CNAME` file remains in the root and the custom domain is configured in the repository settings.
